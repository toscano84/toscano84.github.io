      <description>In this post I’ll work with this dataset from Kaggle which is related to the number of suicides in several countries across many years. However, I won’t make any kind of inferential analysis about the data. My main goal is to make a tutorial about how to work with factors in R by showing the powerful tidyverse package called forcats. I will explore some variables that can be turned into factors and show you the main functions of forcats to help you wrangle data.</description>
