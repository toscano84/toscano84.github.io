      <description>This post will talk about multiple linear regression in the context of machine learning. Linear regression is one of the simplest and most used approaches for supervised learning. This tutorial will try to help you in how to use the linear regression algorithm. I am also new to the machine learning approach, but I’m very interested in this area given the predictive ability that you can gain from this. Let’s hope I can help you.</description>
