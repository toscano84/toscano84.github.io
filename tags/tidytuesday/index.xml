      <description>This tutorial will be about iteration in R. More specifically, I’ll focus on some functions of the purrr package. Feedback is welcomed. The dataset I will manipulate is from the week 22 of TidyTuesday and it’s called Wine Ratings. This dataset is very informative about types of wines and its origins as well as the respective prices and points attributed. Moreover, it’s very detailed in regard to critical reviews and information about critics.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the blog. In this new post I’ll do a short tutorial on how to work with strings in R. I’ll show you some of the main functions of the stringr package and the amazing power of the rebus package. The data frame I will be using is from the week 13 of TidyTuesday. This data frame seemed to be the perfect opportunity to build this tutorial given the importance of strings for its understanding.</description>
