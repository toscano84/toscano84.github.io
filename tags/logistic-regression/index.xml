      <description>In this post, we will fit a multiple logistic regression model to predict the probability of a bank customer accepting a personal loan based on multiple variables to be described later. Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm were the independent variable has a qualitative nature. In this case, corresponding to the acceptance or rejection of a personal loan. This tutorial will build multiple logistic regression models and assess them.</description>
