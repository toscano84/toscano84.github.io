      <description>This post talks about making interactive visualizations in R with leaflet(). In this example, I’ll map the USA locations of two of the biggest coffee chains, Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts. This package allows us to map data and play interactively with it. For instance, we can zoom in or zoom out to augment or diminish map details, respectively. We can add markers that signal the position of our data in the map and move the mouse cursor over to get information about it.</description>

      <title>Tuition costs and gdp per capita: A linear regression analysis</title>

      <description>This post will explore with R one of the simplest approaches to predict a response of a quantitative nature. This approach is called Linear Regression.
I will use a simple Linear Regression to study whether there is any relationship between the gross domestic product (gdp) per capita of each state in the USA and its tuition costs. Therefore, our predictor will be the gdp per capita per state and our response will be the tuition costs per state.</description>

      <title>Using R to analyse the German Federal Election</title>

      <description>As the title of this post implies we will analyze, using the statistical programming language R, the German Federal Election which took place on 24 September of 2017. It will not be an exhaustive analysis of the results. I’m only interested in visualizing the share of the vote that each party represented in the Parliament (i.e. Bundestag) received in each one of the 16 States of Germany.
In order to make this visualization possible in R, loading the respective packages is the first step.</description>
